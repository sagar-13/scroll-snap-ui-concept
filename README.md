# Scroll Snapping Intersection Observer UI

A simple UI created with React, CSS animations, scroll-snap, and react-intersection-observer. 

Combined with scroll snapping, intersection observer is used to trigger animations and state changes when each section enters the viewport. Each section card can also be expanded to take up the full viewport and have its own scrollable content.
